# Family Trees App

A React-based family tree visualization and editing application.

## How to Run

This project uses Vite and runs directly from `src/` with a standard entry `index.html` at the repo root that loads `/src/main.jsx`.

- Development (hot reload): `npm run dev`
- Production build: `npm run build` (outputs to `dist/`)
- Preview production build: `npm run preview`

After this refactor, `dist/` is purely a build artifact and should not contain hand-edited source code.

If you previously opened `dist/index.html` with Live Server, use `npm run dev` now for development, or `npm run preview` after building.
